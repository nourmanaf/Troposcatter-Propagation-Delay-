# Troposcatter-Propagation-Delay-

Welcome to the **Troposcatter-Propagation-Delay-** project! This open-source repository is designed to help researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts analyze and simulate propagation delays in troposcatter communication systems. Troposcatter communication exploits scattering in the troposphere to enable long-distance over-the-horizon (OTH) communication.

## Features

- **Simulation Models**: Includes propagation delay calculations based on ITU-R P.617-5 and other relevant models.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate graphs and charts for signal attenuation, delay vs. distance, and more.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Modify system parameters like distance, and atmospheric conditions.
- **MATLAB Scripts**: Pre-built scripts for easy simulation and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- MATLAB (R2020b or later recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nourmanaf/Troposcatter-Propagation-Delay-.git
   cd Troposcatter-Propagation-Delay-
   ```

2. Open MATLAB or your preferred IDE to start running the simulation scripts.

### Running Simulations

The key MATLAB scripts in this repository include:

- `Nour_code.m`: The main script for running propagation delay calculations.
- `atmosphere_conditions.m`: Simulates the effect of atmospheric conditions on signal propagation.
- `delay_over_year.m`: Analyzes how propagation delays vary over different seasons.
- `haversine.m`: Implements the haversine formula for calculating distances.
- `refractive_index.m`: Calculates the refractive index based on atmospheric parameters.

To run simulations:

1. Open any of the above scripts in MATLAB based on your area of interest.
2. Configure the parameters in the script header (e.g., atmospheric conditions, distance).
3. Run the script to see outputs and visualizations.
